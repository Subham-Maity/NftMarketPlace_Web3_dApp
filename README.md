```Note: Always check commits with description```


### 1. Open the link and [click here](https://thirdweb.com/contracts) to see the third web dashboard and connect to the metamask wallet.
**what is third web ?**

```

**what is MetaMask ?**
```text
MetaMask is a software cryptocurrency wallet used to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. 
It allows users to access their Ethereum wallet through a browser extension or mobile app, 
which can then be used to interact with decentralized applications
```
* ```note if you haven't metamask installed, you can install it by following the link below:``` click [here](https://metamask.io/). 
* ```you can check my guide if you are a complete newbie to metamask.``` click [here](https://github.com/Subham-Maity/solidity-tutorial#what-is-metamask-).
* ```for rinkeby testETH``` click [here](https://faucets.chain.link/rinkeby).  [ working date : 8/24/2022 ]



### 2. NFT mint (Using ThirdWeb)
```for this process you can check this website too``` [here](https://www.quicknode.com/guides/solidity/how-to-mint-an-nft-collection-using-thirdweb).


1. In thirdweb , simple go to NFT collection and press deploy or Thirdweb will deploy the contract for you.
2. Add unique image for now I'm gonna collect the image from [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/cryptopunks)
3. Give it a name and a description and Symbol and you can see the recipient address , royalties and platform fee.
* recipient address - the address where the NFT will be sent.(this is me for now)
* royalties - the amount of ETH that will be sent to the recipient address. 
  *  Percentage - the percentage of the royalties that will be sent to the platform fee. (For now I add 10%)
* Platform fees - the amount of ETH that will be sent to the platform fee.
  *  Percentage - platform fee is the percentage of the royalties that will be sent to the platform fee. (For now I add 10%)
* Network / Chain - the network that the NFT will be deployed on. (For now I add Rinkeby testnet)

4. Click on the deploy and you will see the metamask popup and click on the confirm button that will take minimal amount of fees.
5. Done! Now go to NFTs and mint more NFTs.
 * click on the mint upload nft image (I took that image from [here](https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0xb47e3cd837ddf8e4c57f05d70ab865de6e193bbb/6039) )
 * add description properties (I set accessory and small shade) 
   * you can simply copy from the image description and paste it in the description field.
   * then copy properties and also add row and add more properties like type - male so on.
   * you can also add advance metadata like background color and so on.
   * you can see your metamask will open and you have to pay some fees and there we go nft minted successfully.
   * Now you can transfer it or mint it to another address.
   * And do this same process for more NFTs As much as you can.
